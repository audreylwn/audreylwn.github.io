<h1 class="about-heading">About</h1>

I am a Senior Research Associate at the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN, USA) working in the [Aging and Dementia Imaging Research (ADIR) Laboratory](https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/aging-dementia-imaging/overview) and supported by a research fellowship grant from [Race Against Dementia](https://www.raceagainstdementia.com/).

My research focuses on studying the role of cerebrovascular dysfunction in dementia and cognitive impairment, with the help of multimodal neuroimaging techniques and clinical data in humans.

I am also interested in studying the early risk and resilience factors of dementia, and how neuroimaging markers of cerebral small vessel disease is involved in early dementia pathogenesis. In particular, I am interested in how cerebral small vessel disease relates to established dementia risk factors and molecular imaging markers of dementia (e.g., amyloid, tau, neuroinflammation), as a way to further our understanding of how various pathologies interact in their contribution to neurodegeneration and clinical outcomes. 

On top of my academic work, I support younger researchers as the Early Career Investigator Representative of the [International Society of Vascular Behavioural and Cognitive Disorders (VasCog)](https://www.vascog.org/).
