I am a PhD candidate at the [Old Age Psychiatry Group](http://www.psychiatry.cam.ac.uk/oap/) at the University of Cambridge. My research focuses on understanding the role of cerebrovascular dysfunction in dementia and cognitive impairment, with the help of multimodal neuroimaging techniques and clinical data.

My current research examines cerebral small vessel disease in relation to vascular risk factors and pathological markers of dementia (e.g., amyloid, tau, neuroinflammation) to understand how various pathologies interact in their contribution to neurodegeneration and clinical outcomes.

My PhD is funded by the Fitzwilliam Lee Kuan Yew PhD Scholarship from the University of Cambridge, and my supervisors are [Professor John Oâ€™Brien](https://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/directory/profile.php?jto27) and [Professor Hugh Markus](https://www.neurology.cam.ac.uk/neurology-unit-research-groups/stroke-research-group/people/hugh/).
